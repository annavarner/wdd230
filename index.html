    <h2>Anna</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Anna. I'm 42 years old and live in Northeast Ohio with my husband Mark and our two kids, Lillian (12) and Tyler (6). Both of our kids were adopted as infants and we are so blessed to have them both in our lives. Tyler <b>never stops moving</b>, which is why he always has at least one blurry limb in all pictures. The dog that Lillian is holding in the picture above belongs to my little brother, but she really wishes it was ours. I'm the one in the black and white striped shirt if you weren't sure which one is me.</p>
    <p>I grew up in New York State. I was born in Rochester and my family moved to the Elmira/Corning area in Southern NY at the beginning of my senior year in high school. I received my associate's degree in Liberal Arts from Corning Community College in May 2000 and am finally returning to school to pursue a bachelor's degree in Applied Technologies after taking a couple gap decades to start a family and figure out what I want to do with my life.</p>
    <p>I've been working in the Electronic Security industry in an alarm monitoring center for the past 21 years. I started as a dispatcher and quickly moved up into the panel programming department. My current job is Senior Programming Rep. I'm responsible for programming and maintaining the alarm systems for a major bank.</p>
    <p>I love to read - I usually have 2 or 3 e-books or audio books downloaded to my phone at all times to read during my lunch break at work or whenever I have a few spare minutes. I enjoy cooking and baking - breads and bagels are my specialty. I also make the best cookies.
